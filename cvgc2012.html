			Note: This page is incomplete.  I'm still adding to it, so try and hold off on reading it until it's done...unless you just want to read it twice!<br><br>
			Let me first start off by apologizing again for last year.  I honestly still had a blast, but I realize that it was missing that "magic" from the first year.  Sure, it was going to be hard to beat a "photo-finish" that had to go down to a duck hunt tiebreaker, but I still think that I came up short in 2011.<br>
			<p align=center>I can promise you this; that is NOT going to be the case this year.</p>
		    In addition to me being more "on top of things" I'm asking for help from you all.<br>
			If you haven't done it yet, please check out the <a href="requests.html" onfocus="blur()">Requests</a> page and sign up for a job!<br><br>
			<h2>Charity Info</h2>
			I've been discussing with some of you the possibility of holding a separate charity event at another time in the year.  Since we have to bump up this year's event, I'm going to roll them up into one.<br>
			As many of you probably already know, someone very close to me was diagnosed with cancer last year.  Unfortunately for her, she works 2 low paying jobs in order to support herself and her child, and this secondary income made it difficult for her to get financial support for paying for treatment and drugs.  Luckily this person has a very loving family and caring friends that have helped her along, but I realize that there are some people out there in a similar situation that do not have this level of support in their lives.  So this year I want to help give back and this seems like a good avenue for me to do that.  What does this mean for you?  Not much really.  Everyone is still welcome to visit and play games.  The ONLY additional requirement that I have is that in order to be in the tournament, you have to meet one of the following criteria:<br>
			<ol>
				<li>You must bring an old game (or more than one if you'd like) to be donated to the <a href="http://www.texaschildrens.org/" onfocus="blur()">Texas Children's Hospital of Houston</a>.</li>
				<li>You must purchase something off of the <a href="www.childsplaycharity.org" onfocus="blur()">Child's Play Charity</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/213Z74GX9APJO/?ie=UTF8&tag=childsplaycha-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" onfocus="blur()"> Amazon Wish List</a> for the <a href="http://www.texaschildrens.org/" onfocus="blur()">Texas Children's Hospital of Houston</a>.</li>
				<li>You must bring a $15 entry fee.  This entry fee will be donated to <a href="http://www.mdanderson.org/how-you-can-help/index.html" onfocus="blur()">MD Anderson</a> specifically to provide financial support to cancer patients that need help but make too much money to be elligable for governmental support.</li>
			</ol>
			In addition to all this, we will also be making special shirts for the event where all payments (NOT just proceeds) will go to MD Anderson as well.  Final design and prices will be arriving shortly (I'm expecting the price to be $10).<br><br>
			It should be noted that all cash donations will be matched by FMC Technologies.<br><br>
			<h2>Games</h2>
			Alright, we're going to TRY this again this year.  For this event I want EVERYONE to submit to me their choice for an event.  I'm not going to be as picky as I was the first year in my hopes that we'll get more participation.  What does this mean?  This means that you should feel free to pick weird and wacky games that you might own others in.  Steve-o, that means Uniracers and Ken Griffey are back on the table.  I will still hold final veto power in case we get too many similar games suggested (For example, we wouldn't need to play NBA Jam, NBA Hangtime, and NHL Open Ice as they are all practically the same game).<br><br>
			So I want everyone to email their game and scenario to me (notaburger@gmail.com).<br><br>
			Here is the format that you must follow in your submission (to make my life easier):<br>
			<blockquote>
			Title of game.<br><br>
			Blurb written about the game by you.  Feel free to be creative and/or funny.  Maybe you'd like to tell a story about why you chose the game.<br><br>
			Youtube video showing gameplay or at least the intro video.<br><br>
			Facts<br><hr>
			Release Date:<br>
			System:<br>
			Publisher:<br>
			Developer:<br><br>
			Wikipedia blurb (with the hyperlink to the game's page)<br><br>
			Rules<br><hr>
			Detail your rules for the event.<br>
			Make it simple and to the point.<br><br>
			Scoring<br><hr>
			Base your scoring structure on 12 players.  I will adjust as necessary.
			</blockquote>

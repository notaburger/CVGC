					<h2>The Event</h2>
					For 2014, the tournament will be held on Friday night, but visitors are welcome to come whenever they'd like...even for the whole weekend.  We will be playing games, watching movies, and just having a good time.  Unless I hear any objections, the event will be held:<br>
					<br><blockquote>May 30, 2014 @ 6 PM - 12 AM CST</blockquote><br>
					Erica and I encourage you to bring your significant others and other family members.<br>
					Although there WILL be (lots of) adult beverages available, this is not going to be strictly a "drinking" party.  Typically, everyone does a great job of finding that happy balance.  We're not prudes (I guarantee that I will be holding my own); we just need to keep this event family friendly.  With all that being said, after the tournament is over, all bets are off.  So if drunk people aren't your "thang" you've just been warned.  In the future I see making these boundaries MUCH more well defined, as everyone's kids get older.  Maybe in the next 5-7 years I could see us having "kid friendly" hours and then "adults only" hours.  Don't worry everyone, that's still quite a ways off, so we'll cross that bridge when we get there.<br><br>
					Dinner is not going to be provided, but snacks will be.  If you want to help out, bring something that you like and share it with others.  Like last year I'm sure we'll take up a collection for pizza for those interested.<br><br>
					<h2>Format</h2>
					This is not set in stone yet, so please voice your opinions.  My goal here is to speed up the event and to make it more spectator friendly.  I'm limiting available slots to 16 this year.  Anyone who played in a previous year gets first priority.  Once those spots are filled, any volunteers get the next crack.  Any remaining spots will be filled on a first come, first serve basis.<br>
					<h2>Trophy</h2>
					The rupees will be making their illustrious comeback.<br>
					The winner will also get his/her avatar as the icon for this website leading up to next year's CVGC.  This is to ensure that all the losers will be reminded of their failures every time they visit the site.<br><br>
				</p>
				
				<h1>2014<span class="dark"> Fund Raiser / Party</span></h1>
		   
				<p>
					<h2>The Event</h2>
					This is party time.  We'll be starting the festivities early Saturday, but people can drop in whenever they'd like.  Like Friday, we will be playing games, watching movies, and just having a good time.  Unless I hear any objections, the event will be held:<br>
					<br><blockquote>May 31, 2014 @ 6 PM - 2 AM CST</blockquote><br>
					If you have any kiddos, please leave them at home for this one.  For those of you travelling out of town with youngins, I will be setting something up with one of the grandmas at an offsite domicile.  You will be welcome to have your kids stay with her for the evening so that you can join in the fun with the rest of the crew.<br><br>
					Just like Friday, dinner is not going to be provided, but snacks will be.  If you want to help out, bring something that you like and share it with others.  I'm sure some people will chip in to get something delivered.<br><br>
					<h2>Format</h2>
					Just show up and play!  We will have all sorts of games going throughout the day.  I am going to lean heavily on some of the visitors to run some of the games.  I can guarantee that there will be at least some Xbox LAN play, board games, card games, Arcade, and relaxing.<br>

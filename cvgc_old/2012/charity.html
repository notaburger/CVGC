				<h1>2012<span class="dark"> CVGC - Charity Info</span></h1>
		   
				<p>
					I've been discussing with some of you the possibility of holding a separate charity event at another time in the year.  Since we have to bump up this year's event, I'm going to roll them up into one.<br>
					As many of you probably already know, someone very close to me was diagnosed with cancer last year.  Unfortunately for her, she works 2 low paying jobs in order to support herself and her child, and this secondary income made it difficult for her to get financial support for paying for treatment and drugs.  Luckily this person has a very loving family and caring friends that have helped her along, but I realize that there are some people out there in a similar situation that do not have this level of support in their lives.  So this year I want to help give back and this seems like a good avenue for me to do that.  What does this mean for you?  Not much really.  Everyone is still welcome to visit and play games.  The ONLY additional requirement that I have is that in order to be in the tournament, you have to meet one of the following criteria:<br>
					<ol>
						<li>You must bring an xbox 360, wii, or ps3 game (or more than one if you'd like) to be donated to the <a href="http://www.texaschildrens.org/" onfocus="blur()">Texas Children's Hospital of Houston</a>.</li>
						<li>You must purchase something off of the <a href="www.childsplaycharity.org" onfocus="blur()">Child's Play Charity</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/213Z74GX9APJO/?ie=UTF8&tag=childsplaycha-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" onfocus="blur()"> Amazon Wish List</a> for the <a href="http://www.texaschildrens.org/" onfocus="blur()">Texas Children's Hospital of Houston</a>.</li>
						<li>You must bring a $15 entry fee.  This entry fee will be donated to <a href="http://www.mdanderson.org/how-you-can-help/index.html" onfocus="blur()">MD Anderson</a> specifically to provide financial support to cancer patients that need help but make too much money to be elligable for governmental support.</li>
					</ol>
					In addition to all this, we will also be making special shirts for the event where all payments (NOT just proceeds) will go to MD Anderson as well.  Final design and prices will be arriving shortly (I'm expecting the price to be $10-$15).<br><br>
					UPDATE!!!!!<br>
					Instead of shirts, this year I decided to make Koozies!  Each one will run $5...or you can get 2 for $7.50.  There should be plenty to go around, but everyone gets the option to buy at least one first.<br><br>
					<a href="http://imgur.com/0PzD7"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0PzD7l.jpg" title="Hosted by imgur.com" alt="" /></a><br><br>
					Also, I'm going to be auctioning off the following N64 set:<br>
					<a href="http://imgur.com/ci9HW"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ci9HWl.jpg?1" title="Hosted by imgur.com" alt="" /></a><br><br>
					Bidding will start at $40, but I REALLY hope that some people see fit to offer more (as this set is probably worth about twice that).  I mean, come on, the ONLY N64 game it's missing is Goldeneye.  If the bidding happens to break $100, then I'll step up and BUY Goldeneye to add to the set.<br><br>
					There is also a possibility that some other stuff will be auctioned off, so please come with generous wallets and remember how fortunate we all are to be here playing games instead of worrying about stuff that really matters.<br><br>
					It should be noted that all cash donations will be matched by FMC Technologies.<br><br>

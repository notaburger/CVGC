					<h2>Games</h2>
					Big surprise here but only one person provided their game in the desired format (and only a few more provided a game at all).  So, without further adieu take it away Erica!:<br><br>
					<blockquote>
						<h3>Amplitude</h3>
						I am choosing Amplitude for PlayStation 2 as my game selection.  I chose this game because it's fun to play.  I am neither creative and/or funny so this is the best you are going to get.  Amplitude is a music game where you try to keep the song going by activating the different tracks which correspond to percussion, bass, vocals, etc.  You have to press buttons in an order that is shown on the screen and switch between tracks without missing too many notes.  If you miss a note in a sequence, you have to start over.<br><br>

						Here is a video to freak everybody out :-)<br> 
						<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW023XoUqRo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW023XoUqRo</a><br><br>
			
						And more realistic<br>
						<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttNKNj9UI0o">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttNKNj9UI0o</a><br><br>

						unless you think it needs to be easier??? (oh I do Erica, but it serves them right for not submitting games! hehehehehe)<br><br>

						<h3>FACTS</h3>
						Release Date: March 24, 2003<br>
						System: PlayStation 2<br>
						Publisher: Sony Computer Entertainment<br>
						Developer: Harmonix<br><br>

						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_(video_game)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_(video_game)</a><br><br>

						<h3>RULES</h3>
						I figured best score on one song?  Or maybe best score out of 2 tries on the same song?  That would at least give people who haven't played a chance to try the first time and not worry about screwing up.<br><br>

						<h3>SCORING</h3>
						Highest score wins.<br>
					</blockquote><br>
			
					So where does that leave us then?  Well, lucky for you I decided to not cancel this year and instead just pick the games myself based off random conversations with competitors and strangers.  Since I know most don't care, final scoring will be determined on the day of the event.  Here we go:<br><br>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga">Galaga </a> (Arcade) - We needed a schmup and it just so happens that Erin suggested one.  Sorry dudes, maybe next year we can make <a href="http://youtu.be/7jctFZx4l1Q?t=2m52s">Sexy Parodius</a> happen.<br></li>
						<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_(video_game)">Amplitude</a> (PS2) - Erica already filled us in on this one.  All I can say is...good luck and you HAVE to practice this to have ANY chance of placing.<br></li>
						<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nights_into_dreams">Nights into Dreams</a> (Sega Saturn) - Probably the first 3D game that people could understand how to control...thanks to the special 3D controller.<br></li>
						<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo:_Combat_Evolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a> (Xbox) - If Goldeneye brought FPSers to the consoles, then Halo brought the LAN play.  A staple in dorm rooms in the early 2000s, Halo cannot be overlooked when searching out classic First Person Shooters.  FYI, you get brownie points if you play this game using the Duke (Hell, you get brownie points if you even know what I'm talking about).<br></li>
						<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_Bobble">Bubble Bobble</a> (NES) - One of the most faithful NES arcade ports on the system.  In fact, the popularity of this one probably stems from the console game and not the arcade version.  It's long, challenging, and requires the perfect mix of team work and backstabbing.  This one will certainly be interesting.<br></li>
						<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Bomberman">Mega Bomberman</a> (Sega Genesis) - The Bomberman game that introduced the Rooeys to the series.  Still my most favorite Bomberman of the bunch...which is saying a lot as there are about 200 versions in existance at this point.  Also, you are welcome Charles.<br></li>
						<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniracers">Uniracers</a>(SNES) - Not much to say on this one.  It's not really a classic, but it's certainly good.  I don't think it qualifies to be in the realm as "Michael Jackson's Moonwalker" and "Katamari Damacy" in regards to craziness/weirdness, but hey, I doubt you've ever played it before!  Also, Steven will destroy each and every one of us at this one.<br></li>
						<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart_64">Mario Kart 64</a> (N64) - This one is coming back around for a victory lap.  It was so much fun the first year I just couldn't let this one off the hook two years in a row.  You know it.  You love it.<br></li>
						<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_on_2_Open_Ice_Challenge">2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge</a> (Arcade) - It's NBA Jam on ice.  Nuff said.<br></li>
						<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_ii">Warcraft 2</a> (PC) - The mother of all Real Time Strategy (RTS) games.  This a game that I love and tend to suck at.  Word of advice from someone who's been there:  Playing this game like Sim City is a quick way to die by dragons.<br></li>
						<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_vs._Street_Fighter">X-Men vs. Street Fighter</a> (PC) - This was the first "crossover" Street Fighter game and also the first one to employ the tag feature now ubiquitous with the genre.  It's flashy and fun.<br></li>
						<li>The final <a href="http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/shared-blogs/austin/golden/upload/2011/06/shaq-kazaam.jpg">game</a> is a super secret game that will be revealed the day of the event.  Don't worry though.  Any sort of practice would not help you with this one.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if practicing actually made you worse.</li>

					<h2>Old Stuff</h2>
					Alright, we're going to TRY this again this year.  For this event I want EVERYONE to submit to me their choice for an event.  I'm not going to be as picky as I was the first year in my hopes that we'll get more participation.  What does this mean?  This means that you should feel free to pick weird and wacky games that you might "own" others in.  Steve-o, that means Uniracers and Ken Griffey are back on the table.  I will still hold final veto power in case we get too many similar games suggested (For example, we wouldn't need to play NBA Jam, NBA Hangtime, and NHL Open Ice as they are all practically the same game)...or in case you pick a game that just doesn't make sense for the tournament (we will call this the "no Chris, a speed-run of Fallout is not an acceptable game" rule).<br><br>
					So I want everyone to email their game and scenario to me (notaburger@gmail.com).<br><br>
					Here is the format that you must follow in your submission (to make my life easier):<br><br>
			
					<blockquote>
						<h3>Title of game.</h3><hr>
						Blurb written about the game by you.  Feel free to be creative and/or funny.  Maybe you'd like to tell a story about why you chose the game.<br><br>
						Youtube video showing gameplay or at least the intro video.<br><br>
						<h3>Facts</h3><hr>
						Release Date:<br>
						System:<br>
						Publisher:<br>
						Developer:<br><br>
						Wikipedia blurb (with the hyperlink to the game's page)<br><br>
						<h3>Rules</h3><hr>
						Detail your rules for the event.<br>
						Make it simple and to the point.<br><br>
						<h3>Scoring</h3><hr>
						Base your scoring structure on 12 players.  I will adjust as necessary.
					</blockquote><br>
					
					Please hold off on submitting games until April 1st.  I will post them as I receive them to keep me from getting any unfair advantage.  All games should be submitted by April 21st to allow at least 1 week for everyone to review.<br><br>
					I will post the games here as I receive them.

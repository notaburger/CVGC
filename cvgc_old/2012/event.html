				<h2>The Event</h2>
				Just like it has been for the past 2 years, this event will be held on one night, but visitors are welcome to come whenever they'd like...even for the whole weekend.  We will be playing games, watching movies, and just having a good time.  Unless I hear any objections, the event will be held:<br>
				<br><blockquote>May 5, 2012 @ 4 PM - 2 AM CST</blockquote><br>
				This year Erica and I encourge you to bring your significant others and other family members.  It is perfectly fine to attend the event and not to be involved in the tournament.  Although there WILL be adult beverages available, this is not going to be a "drinking" party.  If you want to come over and drink our drinks and socialize, you are more than welcome to come over just about any other weekend.  Last year we got a little too "distracted" and I'd like to avoid that this year.  On top of that, we need to keep this event family friendly considering the fact that we want to keep this a yearly extraveganza!<br><br>
				Unlike last year, we are not going to try and grill out dinner.  It was exhausting and too time consuming.  Instead, this year we ask you all to bring snacks and/or chip in on some pizza.  I'm thinking that we'll load up on $5 Little Caesar's Pizzas.  Charles decided to be in charge of the food, so if he provides an update to me, I'll post it here.<br><br>
				<h2>Trophy</h2>
				TBD...but if it works out like we are hoping...it's going to be epic<br>
				This new trophy will be a living trophy that gets returned at the end of the winner's reign.<br>
				To put it bluntly, it was a LOT of work and a LOT of money.<br>
				If anyone would like to kick in $2 or $3 to help cover the cost, it would not go unappreciated by me or by Jesse.<br>  I know it seems like we're asking a lot this year, but this will be a one time thing.<br><br>
				The winner will also get his/her avatar as the icon for this website leading up to CVGC 2013.  This is to ensure that all the losers will be reminded of their failures every time they visit the site.<br><br>

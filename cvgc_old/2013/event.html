					<h2>The Event</h2>
					Just like it has been every year, the tournament will be held on Saturday night, but visitors are welcome to come whenever they'd like...even for the whole weekend.  We will be playing games, watching movies, and just having a good time.  Unless I hear any objections, the event will be held:<br>
					<br><blockquote>May 4, 2013 @ 6 PM - 12 AM CST</blockquote><br>
					This year Erica and I encourge you to bring your significant others and other family members.  This year we are significantly scaling back the tournament.  It's going to go MUCH faster, is going to be less hectic, and it will have a greater emphasis on audience interaction.<br>
					Although there WILL be (lots of) adult beverages available, this is not going to be strictly a "drinking" party.  Everyone did a great job last year of finding that happy balance.  We're not prudes (I guarantee that Erica and I will be holding our own); we just need to keep this event family friendly.  With all that being said, after the tournament is over on Saturday night, all bets are off.  So if drunk people aren't your "thang" you've just been warned.  In the future I see making these boundaries MUCH more well defined, as everyone's kids get older.  Maybe in the next 5-7 years I could see us having "kid friendly" hours and then "adults only" hours.  Don't worry everyone, that's still quite a ways off, so we'll cross that bridge when we get there.<br><br>
					Dinner is not going to be provided, but snacks will be.  If you want to help out, bring something that you like and share it with others.  Like last year I'm sure we'll take up a collection for pizza for those interested.<br><br>
					<h2>Format</h2>
					The tournament's format is going to change this year.  Instead of EVERYONE playing EVERY game, this year some people will be knocked out during the event.  It's not set in stone yet, so please voice your opinions.  An example scenario is that a few people are cut every couple rounds.  Another option is to just limit the games and have the top four combatants duke it out in a sort of mini-winner-take-all tournament.  My goal here is to speed up the event and to make it more spectator friendly.  I'm limiting available slots to 16 this year (which is 4 spots MORE than last year).  Anyone who played in a previous year gets first priority.  Once those spots are filled, any volunteers get the next crack.  Any remaining spots will be filled on a first come, first serve basis.
					<h2>Trophy</h2>
					TBD...but it will most likely be the rupees from last year.  It looks like we were able to make the red one shine.  I'll see what we can do about getting the others all gussied up before the event.  No matter WHAT, expect them to have some character.<br>
					The winner will also get his/her avatar as the icon for this website leading up to CVGC 2014.  This is to ensure that all the losers will be reminded of their failures every time they visit the site.<br><br>

		Alright folks.  As I said last year (before I knew I was having a kid) that I'm going to need a little bit of help keeping this train rolling.<br>
		Please post in the comments if you want to take a job.  The first to claim something, gets it.<br>
		<h2>Roles</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Beer Brewing Assistant<br>
				<span  class="dark">The warp whistle doesn't make itself.  FYI, this will be the sweetest job as it mostly involves imbibing.</span></li><br>
				<li>Trophy Designer/Fabricator<br>
				<span class="dark">Last year's trophy was never created.  The one from the first year was nice, but I just didn't have the time to create a new fake NES label.  It would be kind of neat to have a shelf of fake games as trophies though. ;)  This person can do whatever they want.  The only requirement is that the trophy be a physical thing.  Examples include: World's Best Dad trophy with "Gamer" written over "Dad", a T-Shirt, a custom NES cart, etc.  Eventually, I would like to have a Stanley Cup-esque trophy that gets passed around every year (Lord Davey's Trophy does have a nice ring to it).</span></li><br>
				<li>T-Shirt Builder<br>
				<span class="dark">The design from last year was great, it's just sad that I never got around to making everyone's shirt.  This year we can make the shirts in advance and MAYBE even personalize them with your handle if you'd like.  Note: We might have to take up collections for this.</span></li><br>
				<li>TV Sharer<br>
				<span class="dark">We're going to need another 42" (ish) TV.  My hope is that we play some xbox system link games this year (Timesplitters, Crimson Skies, Halo, Burnout).</span></li><br>
				<li>Photographer<br>
				<span class="dark">Erica has a nice camera that I'm sure she'd let you use (if you're careful), or you could just bring your own decent point and shoot.  The point is, WE NEED MORE PICTURES!  Due to the fact that everyone is always busy gaming, we've only ended up with a few from years past.</span></li><br>
			</ol>
			As I think of more stuff, I'll add it here.<br>
			THANKS!<br>

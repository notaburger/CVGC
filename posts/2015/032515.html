							<b>Summary:</b><br>
							On October 13, 2014 the Haire family was involved in an accident from which they would endure unimaginable loss. The accident claimed the life of their 8 month old daughter Aubrey and critically injured their 4 year old daughter Brooke. Brooke was forced to go into emergency surgery and was left paralyzed from the neck down and temporarily dependent on a pacemaker and feeding tube. They have been faced with the mission of mourning the loss of a child while simultaneously working to rehabilitate Brooke and help her to adjust to life with her disability. This adjustment will require the purchase of 2 kinds of wheel chairs (for which their insurance will only cover one), home modifications for wheel chair accessibility and a wheel chair accessible vehicle. These costs are in addition to the medical and physical therapy expenses that they have already incurred and will continue to incur. Despite their loss they have somehow managed to maintain a positive outlook. Brooke has been especially strong and has even provided reassurance to her parents that everything will be okay. She is no longer dependent on her breathing tube and is becoming less dependent on her pacemaker. There are indications that the nerves in Brooke’s legs and feet are still alive and the family is determined to do everything in their power to help Brooke walk again. The donations from this event will have a direct impact on the quality of life and well-being of Brooke and her family.<br><br>

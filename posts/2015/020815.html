						<p>
							It was a dark and stormy night.  Those assholes from Seattle had arrived in San Antonio and brought their shitty weather with them.  Luckily, they also brought PAX with them, so it wasn't a total loss.
						</p>
						<p>
							Thursday night was PAX-eve, and while I was busy packing for PAX, some lucky souls were in San Antonio for pub crawls.  I don't really have much to add, other than who doesn't like a good pub crawl?  If this interests you, apparently it's possible to set limits on how many people can go on a pub crawl, and these have such a limit, so book early!  Or, you know, just think to yourself "maybe I should go down the night before so I can maybe find some cool bars".
						</p>
						<p>The shitty weather (I didn't make that part up) continued through Friday morning, and made for a fun 3 hour drive to San Antonio.  After it became apparent we would not make it in time to go to the Q&A panel that Drew wanted to go to, we started looking for somewhere to eat lunch that would have some delicious craft beer.  <a href="http://www.bighops.com/">Big Hops Gastropub</a> proved to be that and so much more.  It was a little bit out of the way, but worth every inch.  We just happened to catch this place during a bacon week, which means they pair a flight of beer with a flight of their house cured bacon.  The flight paired Karbach Weisse Versa with pineapple bacon, Ranger Creek Dark Side of the Hop with Jamaican jerk bacon, Freetail Soul doubt IPA with sriracha bacon, and Guadalupe Chocolate Stout with white chocolate bacon.  Unless you are not of this world and hate bacon, check this place out.  Because it might not have been clear before, <b>they cure all of their bacon in-house</b>.  As such, order some food with bacon to go with your delicious beer.  Or, if the stars align and you find yourself there during bacon week, order a flight - it's worth it.  If I had understood they cured all of their bacon in house before I ordered, I would have ordered a BLT.  Thankfully, the dish I ordered at least had bacon in it - their smoked mac and cheese.  And, you know, that flightâ€¦  They also fill growlers for good prices, so bring your growler.  Too bad they don't have bacon growlers!<br>

						<p>One of the highlights of Friday was finding ourselves thrust into the Mario Kart 8 tournament.  We were patiently waiting in line to play some console games when the folks running the tournament announced that they had some no-shows.  In a moment of pure selflessness, we volunteered to round out the field of 64.  The participants were split into groups of 4 and each group did one random track on 150 CC, with 1st and 2nd places advancing.  I got 3rd in my first and only race, proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that I was not the worst person at Mario Kart in attendance at PAX.  As I said, 1st and 2nd advanced and repeated this same set up for the field of 32.  At some point it switched to 3 races to determine who moved on (I think it was when there were 16 drivers left), and this continued until there were only 4 drivers left, at which point they did 3 races for all the marbles!  The tournament did prove to be extra exciting, when our very own Big D made it through to the final round.  He managed to prove he was the 4th best Mario Kart driver at PAX!  I'm sure David will have more details on the thrill he felt advancing through the rounds.  Also, he is probably a YouTube celebrity, now - the tournament was won by a "YouTuber" who taped all of his races (or at least the two match-ups I witnessed between him and David).  Keep this in mind when Mario Kart 8 is suggested for CVGC.<br>

						</p>
						<p>
							Also on Friday, we went to the concerts.  We saw Freezepop, MC Frontalot, and the Minibosses.  The sound system was pretty bad, but the Minibosses were still very entertaining.  Freezepop and MC Frontalot aren't really my thing, but I'm sure they were great too.  I had an impossible time understanding Frontalot (which I think is normal), but I also had a hard time understanding Freezepop due to the sound system, and I assume that isn't normal.  Also, while standing around in Bandland, I did come up with a brilliant gag.  You see, I get in line at the Freezepop booth, and then when I get to the front, I ask for a "blue".  They would obviously recognize the totally understandable confusion and explain to me that they're a band and not a popsicle booth.  I would then ask for a "raspberry".  It's apparently important that I ask for a color and then a flavor.  This goes on until they kick me out.  It's like a modern day Abbott and Costello.  It's hilarious.  Maybe you had to be there.  The only problem with this plan is that they don't have alcohol at the convention.
						</p>
						<p>
							Walking back Friday night, I, and others, worked up a powerful thirst.  As such, we stopped at the Alamo Street Eat Bar.  I highly recommend this place.  They had good beer and the food trucks were amazing.  I ate at SAbores that night, some Mexican food truck on a bus, and thoroughly enjoyed my pastor tacos.  They perfectly complimented the pint of 4-Squared.  It goes without saying, but we returned again Saturday night.  On Saturday we ate pizza from the Sulla Strada truck, and it was very good.
						</p>
						<p>
							For Saturday morning, we planned to go to the Geek Bars and Restaurants panel.  Sadly, we did not make it on time.  Of course, we still had a great day!  I would definitely recommend arriving at least 30 - probably 45 - minutes before any panels you want to see.  Also, the panel appears to be on <a href="http://youtu.be/HaNJ587ARDA">YouTube</a>, so we can still watch it.
						</p>
						<p>
							One of the highlights from Saturday was playing Knight Squad.  From a distance, it resembled Bomberman, but after getting a closer look and playing it, PvP Gauntlet is a better description.  It has all the modes you'd expect, like death match, team death match, capture the <strike>flag</strike> grail, and a challenge mode (single player).  Sadly, the multiplayer is just local, now, but they do say they intend to add online play.  I played death match and thought it seemed well balanced.  I enjoyed it enough to pick up a copy at PAX.  I definitely could see it being fun with a group of people playing it locally, but right now it'd just be as a break from Towerfall, I'm afraid.
						</p>
						<p>
							Also on Saturday I made my first foray into the world of painting miniatures.  Reaper Miniatures was giving away miniatures and had tables set up to paint.  Mine was a work of art, but someone stole it and replaced it with one painted by an ape.  Luckily I snapped a picture of it before it was stolen:<br>
							<img src="posts/2015/MiniPreTheft.JPG" height="250" width="184"><br>
							And here is the one painted by an ape:<br>
							<img src="posts/2015/MiniPostTheft.jpg" height="354.5" width="200"><br>
							Seriously, though, mine did turn out better than I expected.  I should have taken a picture when it was "fresher", because apparently I didn't put enough layers of paint on and it wears off quickly.  Also, this picture looks a lot worse than it does in person.  The instructions provided probably could have been better, but I'm not sure I have the patience for it, and certainly didn't at PAX.  It was a unique way to kill over an hour though - probably better than standing in line.
						</p>
						<p>We wrapped up Saturday at the tabletop room, trying our hand at Galactic Strike Force.  It was, shall we say, complicated.  I found the instructions to be very poorly organized.  They also seemed to be missing instructions for what appeared to be part of the game (text on cards that seemed to explain some mechanic).  I'd give it another shot, but only with someone that knew what they were doing or after watching a video explaining it.  Someone from the company tried to talk us through it briefly on Sunday, and I do think it was good strategy advice, but it didn't really help me understand the rules of the game.</p>
						<p>
							Nothing really major at the convention on Sunday.  Just kind of wandered around and was noncommittal about getting in lines.  Played a few games and saw Bierzerkers, which looks like a fun time killer - basically a cartoony version of Chivalry.  I signed up for their <a href="http://www.bierzerkers.com/wordpress/alpha-sign-up/">alpha</a>, but haven't heard anything yet (or have their newsletter in my spam folder).
						</p>
						<p>
							I did try Gunnar glasses on Sunday.  I think something like that could be nice for staring at a computer screen all day, but I think I underestimated how bad my eyesight is.  Or the claims of people being able to use them instead of their glasses are grossly exaggerated/misrepresented (or made up by me).
						</p>
						<p>
							Another thing we checked out on Sunday was called Skreens TV.  It's a box that you can plug several devices into and then display them on a TV.  It has a mobile app for resizing windows and moving them around.  All in all, it seemed pretty interesting.  I'm not sure how much I buy into their "monitor your fantasy team while watching football" use case - I'm pretty sure everyone just monitors that on their tablet or laptop and doesn't care to have it on the screen.  I could be wrong, though.  All in all, it definitely sounded like a neat product and, while I won't be spending $200 to get one, it does seem like a pretty fair price for such a device.  That said, I just found an <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/skreenstv-streamline-your-tv-experience">Indiegogo</a> campaign for them from November - December 2014, and that price point ($400) is very different than what they projected at PAX.  The campaign also failed miserably, so maybe they've discovered some miracle that cuts their manufacturing costs by at least 50%.
						</p>
						<p>
							We wrapped up Sunday at Rosario's Mexican Cafe, and it was delicious.  I had pastor tacos and a michelada - both were delicious.  The michelada had chili lime salt on it that was out of this world.  Definitely something I'll have to look into buying or making (the salt, that is - probably won't buy many micheladas, although making them is a different story).
						</p>
						<p>
							All in all, it was a great time!  3 days might be a bit much for me, and San Antonio stole the show a bit, but I'll give the whole thing another shot.  I'll definitely be more prepared next time and have a schedule, even if it says "kill 5 hours in the expo hall".

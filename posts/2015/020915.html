						<p>Every once in a while we get a few people together for the weekend to try out some new tabletop games and see how we like them.  It is kind of like a 
						trial run to find some tabletop games to put out at CVGC that won't be too intimidating for non tabletoppers and can realistically be played in a 
						reasonable amount of time. So, like, not <a href="http://amzn.com/1589942108"><font color="green">Arkham Horror</font></a>.  We always have a lot of fun 
						and usually end of finding a game or two we want to buy before the weekend is over.</p>
						
						<p>For more information about any of the games I am discussing in this post, I am providing the Amazon link and, if available, a link to a TableTop 
						video where you can watch the game being played by Wil Wheaton and his other guests.  Both of these links will be directly below the image.</p>

						<p><b><font size="3">Sentinels of the Multiverse</font></b></p>
						
						<p><img src="posts/2015/Sentinels.jpg"/></p>
						
						<p><a href="http://amzn.com/B0095ZFA5Q">Amazon Link</a><br></p>
						
						<p>The first game we tried out was Sentinels of the Multiverse.  David and I attempted this game at QuakeCon 2014 but we had to turn in the game 
						because of a tournament.  I didn't know people still played Magic the Gathering... Unfortunately, we did not get very far past the set up and I 
						was very confused about what we were doing and how the game was played.  I don't think I could have even told you what the point of the game was.  
						The guy working at Tabletop Village was very nice and offered to help us if we decided to try the game again at a later time but we decided against 
						it and ended up not attempting the game again.</p>
						
						<p><b>About the Game:</b>
						<br>Sentinels of the Multiverse is a cooperative game where players become powerful super heroes, controlled using cards, who battle evil villains 
						in an attempt to protect the Multiverse.  The game supports two to five players controlling three to five heroes (two players must control a third 
						ghost player) who must work together and survive deadly villain attacks along with dangerous environmental conditions to successfully defeat the 
						villain.</p>
						
						<p><b>Gameplay:</b>
						<br>This is a cooperative game in which each player has their own deck of 40 cards and a character card, which gives the specifics of each hero.  During
						their turn, each player is able to play a card from their hand, use one of the powers provided by the cards they have placed in play, and draw a new card 
						to be placed in the players hand.  After all the heroes have had their turn, the villain and the environment then get a turn.  Once a player has lost all of
						their HP they are still able to participate in the game and aid the other heroes.  The game ends when either all the heroes have been defeated by the 
						villain, the villain has been reduced to 0 or fewer HP, or and alternate win condition which is met.</p>
						
						<p>
							<b>Number of Players:</b> 2-5 (best with 4)<br>
							<b>Play Time:</b> 60 minutes<br>
						</p>
						
						<p><b>Difficulty:</b>
						<br>For me this game was one of the more difficult ones to learn.  It definitely is not Arkham Horror hard, but I have played games that were 
						quite a bit easier to pick up initially.  The main problem for me starting out was not really knowing what cards were good and which ones weren't 
						all that great.	I think it took me the whole game to figure out what we were actually supposed to do, though it may have helped if I had paid a 
						little more attention while we were going over the manual.  I'm not always in the mood for a game that requires a lot of reading and remembering
						details and I probably wasn't in the right frame of mind for this game when we started so I never truly got into the game.</p>
						
						<p><b>Recommendation:</b>
						<br>I would most likely recommend this game but it is probably not CVGC material.  The cards and characters are pretty involved and you have to 
						remember a lot different details for things that can and can't happen depending on cards that are in play.  It would be a fun game to play if 
						you are looking for a new game to add to your collection, but I know at least I wouldn't want to attempt this game on a weekend like CVGC.  Especially 
						if it is my first time playing.</p>
						
						<p><b><font size="3">7 Wonders</font></b></p>
						
						<p><img src="posts/2015/7Wonders.jpg" height="300" width="300"/></p>
						
						<p><a href="http://amzn.com/B0043KJW5M">Amazon Link</a><br></p>
						
						<p>The next game we played was 7 Wonders.  This wasn't the first time we played this game, we played it before the last CVGC, but I had been wanting to play
						and we didn't realize there was a more difficult option which can be played with two players.  It apparently involves using a ghost third player and is only 
						recommended for people who are already pretty familiar with the game.  Since it was going to only be our second time playing, we decided we weren't quite at 
						that level yet.  It didn't help that we had already put the game back in the box and didn't want to get it back out.  We moved on to a game we were already 
						familiar with.</p>
						
						<p><b>About the Game:</b>
						<br>7 Wonders is a competitive card game where you become the leader of one of the seven great cities of the Ancient World.  During the game you attempt to build
						up your empire by gathering resources, learning sciences, building up your military, and erecting a wonder.  The game supports two to seven players who fight to 
						get the most victory points by the end of the three ages.</p>
						
						<p><b>Gameplay:</b>
						<br>This is a competitive game where each player randomly receives a game board depicting on of the original seven wonders of the world.  These boards are double sided 
						which allows for an easier or a more difficult version of the game.  The game has 3 ages, each involving their own deck of cards.  In each age, cards are passed around
						the table and every time a player gets a new hand they are able to play a card based on what they already have in play in front of them.  The age continues until 
						there are no more cards to play.  After the three ages have been completed then you add up your total points and see who has the most victory points.</p>
						
						<p>
							<b>Number of Players:</b> 2-7<br>
							<b>Play Time:</b> 30 minutes<br>
						</p>
						
						<p><b>Difficulty:</b>
						<br>I don't remember this game being too difficult the first time but I could be wrong.  It has been over almost a year since the first time we tried the game out.
						I am not quick at picking up on new games, probably because I am so terrible at listening to what we need to do, so it almost always takes me at least one game 
						through before I know what the heck is going on.  I usually learn better through actual game time because usually the instructions don't even make sense if you haven't
						already played the game.</p>
						
						<p><b>Recommendation:</b>
						<br>I probably wouldn't recommend this game for CVGC mostly because it has a lot of small parts and can take up a lot of space.  It has a little more strategy
						involvement than I would recommend for a quick, fun game and it can get confusing if people don't give 100% of their focus to what is going on.  Also, there is some 
						(easy) math involved when adding up the scores and ain't nobody got time for that with all the craziness of CVGC going on around them.</p>
						
						<p><b><font size="3">Last Night on Earth: The Zombie Game</font></b></p>

						</p>
						
						<p>Chris was generous enough to bring along his copy of Last Night on Earth for us to try out.  I will tell you right now that I wasn't there for the initial set-up
						and maybe the first few turns so I wasn't really sure what we were doing, I just went along with whatever I was told to do.  I am pretty sure our trial run went a lot 
						smoother and faster than intended but the heroes had some lucky draws so we won pretty quickly.</p>
						
						<p><b>About the Game:</b>
						<br>Last Night on Earth puts a team of brain eating zombies against a group of small-town heroes who must survive the night by working together and either stopping
						the zombie horde or escaping alive.  The game supports two to six players with one set controlling four heroes and one or two players controlling the zombies.  Each 
						hero has their own special abilities to use while fighting for their life in several different scenarios which include survival, rescue, or escape.  The game is kept
						interesting through different character, scenario, and board combinations to offer a lot of replayability.</p>
						
						<p><b>Gameplay:</b>
						<br>I guess this game can be described as a competitive cooperative game?  Is that a thing?  It is competitive because of the zombies trying to eat the brains of all 
						the living characters but it is cooperative due to the fact that the people playing as the heroes must work together to defeat the zombies.  I guess the zombie players 
						would also be considered a cooperative team but how do zombies communicate to come up with a plan?  I think it would be much more realistic if the zombies just did 
						their own thing... but that's my opinion.  Anyway, each team has a deck of cards which contains events and and heroes have cards with items.  During each round, the 
						heroes have a turn and then the zombies take their turn.  Players and zombies move around the board and fight each other depending on the objective of the scenario.  I 
						know that doesn't tell you much, but right now I am going for a general, broad overview of the game.  A very general, broad overview.  The game is won by the heroes if 
						they are able to complete the scenario and the game is won by the zombies if they complete their scenario objective, if they kill the four hero players, or if they cause 
						the last card of the hero deck to be discarded.</p>
						
						<p>
							<b>Number of Players:</b> 2-6<br>
							<b>Play Time:</b> 60-90 minutes<br>
						</p>
						
						<p><b>Difficulty:</b>
						<br>This game was fairly easy to pick up for a first run through.  It didn't make a difference that I literally sat down and joined the game after if had started, I had 
						no problem jumping in and helping the heroes win the game.  It may have taken my first turn to understand what was going on, but after that I had no problem.  It probably
						helped that the game was cooperative because I am pretty sure that having other people on my team that knew what was going on is most likely what saved me.  That being 
						said, I think the heroes got incredibly lucky on the draws and got everything we needed in the first few turns so the zombies didn't really have much of a fair chance.</p>
						
						<p><b>Recommendation:</b>
						I can't really recommend this game as a CVGC game since we don't own it but I would probably recommend it to buy.  The modular board, multiple scenarios, and different 
						playable characters allow for a high level of replayability which would be good for a game if you plan on buying it.  If somebody wants to try it out during the CVGC weekend, 
						we are going to have to nicely ask Chris if he will be willing to bring his copy along.  Otherwise, you are SOL.</p>

						<p>David bought a bunch of tabletop games off of Amazon this holiday season during a huge sale and this was one of the games he picked up.  We have played it several times
						because it has minimal set up, there are very few cards and game pieces involved, it's easy to learn, and the games go pretty fast.  I am pretty sure we used this as a break
						between some of the other games so that we could have a little breather and play something easy.</p>
						
						<p><b>About the Game:</b>
						<br>Love Letter is a game where you are and eligible young man who is attempting to win the affection of the Princess of Tempest.  Unfortunately, she has locked herself away 
						in her palace and you must now rely on others to get your letter of affection to the princess.  The game supports two to four players all playing against each other to fight
						for Princess Annette's affection.</p>
						
						<p><b>Gameplay:</b>
						<br>Basically, you go around the table trying to eliminate other players using the cards in your hand.  What card you play dictates what your next action will be.  You go 
						around taking turns trying to eliminate the others until one person is left.  The last person remaining receives an object of the Princess's affection, and the player who 
						reaches the predetermined amount of objects of affection first wins the game.  Pretty simple.</p>
						
						<p>
							<b>Number of Players:</b> 2-4<br>
							<b>Play Time:</b> 20 minutes<br>
						</p>
						
						<p><b>Difficulty:</b>
						<br>This game is not difficult at all.  One round during the game should only take a few minutes and it is easy enough to pick up in one round.  Even somebody who doesn't normally
						play tabletop games should have no problem learning this game.</p>
						
						<p><b>Recommendation:</b>
						<br> I would definitely recommend this game as one to play during CVGC.  Because the game is so simple and it plays really quickly, it would be fun to do for a few minutes while
						you are waiting your turn on another game in the tournament, or if you just want something easy and fun.</p>

						<p><b>About the Game:</b>
						<br>Play as a trusted member of the Japanese Emperor's court who is given the difficult task of tending to his bamboo garden.  Players must cultivate land plots, irrigate 
						them, and grow one of the three species of bamboo, with the assistance of the Imperial Gardener, to maintain the bamboo garden.  This game supports two to four players who are 
						working against each other to earn more points.</p>
						
						<p><b>Gameplay:</b>
						<br>During this game players will farm parcels of land, irrigate them, and grow the different species of bamboo.  Each player starts with some objective cards.  Based on the 
						objectives you receive, you place the tiles, irrigate, and grow bamboo to help you complete as many objectives as possible.  The game ends when a player completes 7-9 objectives, 
						depending on the number of players.  After a player has reached the correct number of completed objectives, all the players add up the points on their completed objective 
						cards and the person with the most points wins the game.</p>
						
						<p>
							<b>Number of Players:</b> 2-4 (best with 3)<br>
							<b>Play Time:</b> 45 minutes<br>
						</p>
						
						<p><b>Difficulty:</b>
						<br>This game was fairly easy to learn.  We only played once and I had picked up the main idea of the game within the first move or two.</p>
						
						<p><b>Recommendation:</b>
						<br>I think I would recommend this game for play at CVGC.  Not because it's a game with an adorable, cute panda that can eat pink, green, and yellow bamboo, but because I think it
						was my favorite game of the tabletop game weekend.  Though that may be because I had played some of the other games previously so those weren't as exciting to me.  I would recommend buying
						it as well.  Especially if you want an easy, not very confusing tabletop game.</p>

						<p><b>About the Game:</b>
						<br>Play as a merchant of the Renaissance trying to buy gem mines, means of transportation, and shops in an attempt to acquire the most prestige points.  If you collect enough wealth, you 
						may even receive a visit from a prestigious noble, further increasing your prestige.  This game supports two to four players, but is best experienced when played with three people.</p>
						
						<p><b>Gameplay:</b>
						<br>Each person uses cards and gem chips to try and get to 15 prestige points before their fellow players.  There are three different levels of cards that can be bought, each level being 
						more difficult to acquire than the previous.  Players can pick up gems or cards on their turn so that they can purchase cards with prestige points and gems on them.  Buy enough gems and you can 
						lure nobles, which also give prestige points. </p>
						
						<p>
							<b>Number of Players:</b> 2-4 (best with 3)<br>
							<b>Play Time:</b> 30 minutes<br>
						</p>
						
						<p><b>Difficulty:</b>
						<br>This game was fairly easy to pick up initially but took a little longer to figure out the strategy.  Well, at least for me.  David always gives me a hard time about taking a long time for 
						my moves, but I am always trying to plan the next few moves, so I know what I need to do to get to where I want to be at the end of the game.  I found that it requires a lot more planning 
						and strategy when playing with three players, rather than two, so that made it a bit more interesting and more difficult.</p>
						
						<p><b>Recommendation:</b>
						<br>I am kind of on the fence about recommending this game for CVGC.  While I do enjoy the game, it may be a bit too involved for CVGC.  Well, at least for me it would be.</p>
						
						<p><b><font size="3">Final Thoughts:</font></b>
						<br>There will be no shortage of games to play this year at CVGC.  Whether you choose to participate in the tournament or you just come to hang out, have a good time, and support
						a good cause, there will be something fun for everybody.  Tabletop games can be a lot of fun and are a great alternative to the video games that I am sure you will be getting plenty
						of the rest of the night.</p>
						
						<p><b><font size="3">Other Game Recommendations:</font></b>
						<br> Since we have an extensive and rapidly growing tabletop selection, there is no possible way for us to try out every game and see if it's appropriate for play during
						CVGC.  If you have a recommendation or a game you would like to bring along, be sure to leave a comment below.  I think the games best suited for play during CVGC have short 
						and easy to understand instructions, don't include a lot of pieces/cards/parts to keep up with, allow for cooperative play or fun competition (nothing too serious!), 
						and aren't so involved that you can't try to keep up with tournament happenings and other events going on.</p> 
						
						<p>Here is a list of other games, in no particular order, which I will recommend for play during CVGC (and purchase) that we do own but didn't get a chance to play during our 
						tabletop game weekend this year:</p>
						
						<p>
							<b>Cards Against Humanity</b> - If you have been to CVGC in the past, I am pretty sure we have played this.  We have a bunch of expansions, including the 10 Days or Whatever 
							of Kwanzaa.  This game is especially fun for a large group.  As the lady at staples made obvious, this game is not recommended if you are easily offended.<br>
							<b>Boss Monster</b> - Fun retro-inspired dungeon building card game.<br>
							<b>The Resistance</b> - This is a fun, easy game for group to play where you try to guess the other players identities (resistance or spy).<br>
							<b>Pandemic</b> - Fun cooperative game where you try to save the world from a horrible pandemic.<br>
							<b>Pandemic The Cure</b> - Cooperative dice version of Pandemic<br>
							<b>Forbidden Island</b> - Cooperative game where players try to discover all the treasures before the island sinks!<br>
						</p>
						
						<p>If you aren't very adventurous and still want to play a tabletop game, we do have the always popular games such as monopoly, jenga, scrabble, and others on hand available 
						to play if that is what you choose.  You won't be judged, too much...</p>

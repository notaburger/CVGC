						<p>Every once in a while we get a few people together for the weekend to try out some new tabletop games and see how we like them.  It is kind of like a 
						trial run to find some games to put out at CVGC that won't be too intimidating for non tabletoppers and can realistically be played in a 
						reasonable amount of time. So, like, not <a href="http://amzn.com/1589942108"><font color="green">Arkham Horror</font></a>.  We always have a lot of fun 
						and usually end of finding a game or two that we want to buy before the weekend is over.</p>
						
						<p>For more information about any of the games I am discussing in this post, I am providing the Amazon link and, if available, a link to a TableTop 
						video where you can watch the game being played by Wil Wheaton and his other guests.  Both of these links will be directly below the image.</p>
						
						<p>As far as the recommendations go, I am making suggestions for these games based on if they would be a good choice to play at CVGC, not if I would recommend 
						them in general.  Don't get me wrong, I would for sure recommend each and every one of these wonderful games for play if you wish to try it out another time 
						away from the event.  For CVGC recommendations I am taking into consideration the time constraints due to other activities, how much I think people will want 
						to have to set up and read,  and how difficult the game would be to learn quickly for people who haven't played.
						

						<p><b><font size="3">Sentinels of the Multiverse</font></b></p>
						
						<p><img src="posts/2015/Sentinels.jpg"/></p>
						
						<p><a href="http://amzn.com/B0095ZFA5Q">Amazon Link</a><br></p>
						
						<p>The first one we tried out was Sentinels of the Multiverse.  David and I attempted to play this at QuakeCon 2014 but we had to turn it in 
						because of an upcoming tournament that was taking over the area.  I didn't know people still played Magic the Gathering... Unfortunately, we 
						did not get very far past the set up and I was very confused about what we were doing and how we were supposed to play.  I don't think I could have 
						even told you what the point of the game was.  The guy working at Tabletop Village was very nice and offered to help us if we decided to try 
						it again at a later time, but we decided against it and ended up not giving it another shot that weekend.</p>
						
						<p><b>About the Game:</b>
						<br>Sentinels of the Multiverse is a cooperative game where players become powerful super heroes, controlled using cards, who battle evil villains 
						in an attempt to protect the Multiverse.  Two to five players are supported controlling three to five heroes (two players must control a third 
						ghost player) who must work together and survive deadly villain attacks along with dangerous environmental conditions to successfully defeat the 
						villain.</p>
						
						<p><b>Gameplay:</b>
						<br>This is a cooperative game in which each player has their own deck of 40 cards and a character card, which gives the specifics of each hero.  During
						their turn, each player is able to play a card from their hand, use one of the powers provided by the cards they have placed in play, and draw a new card 
						to be placed in the players hand.  After all the heroes have had their turn, the villain and the environment then get a turn.  Once a player has lost all of
						their HP they are still able to participate and aid the other heroes.  The game ends when either all the heroes have been defeated by the villain, the 
						villain has been reduced to 0 or fewer HP, or an alternate win condition has been met.</p>
						
						<p>
							<b>Number of Players:</b> 2-5 (best with 4)<br>
							<b>Play Time:</b> 60 minutes<br>
						</p>
						
						<p><b>Difficulty:</b>
						<br>For me this was one of the more difficult ones to learn.  It definitely is not Arkham Horror hard, but I have played games that were 
						quite a bit easier to pick up initially.  The main problem for me starting out was not really knowing what cards were good and which ones weren't 
						all that great.	I think it took me the whole time we were playing to figure out what we were actually supposed to do, though it may have helped 
						if I had paid a little more attention while we were going over the manual.  I'm not always in the mood for a game that requires a lot of reading 
						and remembering	details and I probably wasn't in the right frame of mind when we started, so I never truly got into it.</p>
						
						<p><b>Recommendation:</b>
						<br>I would most likely recommend Sentinels but it is probably not CVGC material.  The cards and characters are pretty involved and you have to 
						remember a lot different details for things that can and can't happen depending on cards that are in play.  It would be  fun to play if you are looking 
						for something new to add to your collection, but I know at least I wouldn't want to attempt something like this on a weekend like CVGC.  Especially 
						if it is my first time playing.</p>
						
						<p><b><font size="3">7 Wonders</font></b></p>
						
						<p><img src="posts/2015/7Wonders.jpg" height="300" width="300"/></p>
						
						<p><a href="http://amzn.com/B0043KJW5M">Amazon Link</a><br></p>
						
						<p>Next up was 7 Wonders.  This wasn't the first time we played this game (we played it before the last CVGC) but I had been wanting to play it again.  
						There is a more difficult option which can be played with two players, but it involves using a ghost third player and is only recommended for people who 
						are already pretty advanced players.  Since we've only played it a few times, David and I haven't tried playing it this way yet.</p>
						
						<p><b>About the Game:</b>
						<br>7 Wonders is a competitive card game where you become the leader of one of the seven great cities of the Ancient World.  During the each age you attempt 
						to build up your empire by gathering resources, learning sciences, building up your military, and erecting a wonder.  Two to seven players fight against 
						each other to get the most victory points by the end of the three ages.</p>
						
						<p><b>Gameplay:</b>
						<br>This is a competitive game where each player randomly receives a board depicting one of the original seven wonders of the world.  These boards are double 
						sided which allows for an easier or a more difficult versions.  The game has 3 ages, each involving their own deck of cards.  In each age, cards are passed 
						around the table and every time a player gets a new hand they are able to play a card based on what they already have in play in front of them.  It's fun 
						because you have to try to play cards that you want while still limiting the cards and resources that you give to your neighbor.  The age continues until there
						are no more cards to play.  After the three ages have been completed then you add up your total points and see who has the most victory points.</p>
						
						<p>
							<b>Number of Players:</b> 2-7<br>
							<b>Play Time:</b> 30 minutes<br>
						</p>
						
						<p><b>Difficulty:</b>
						<br>I don't remember anything being too difficult the first time we played, but I could be wrong since that was so long ago.  I am not quick at picking up on 
						new games, probably because I am so terrible at listening to what we need to do, so it almost always takes me at least one play through before I know what the 
						heck is going on.  I usually learn better through actual play time because the instructions on these types of games rarely make sense if you haven't 
						played before.</p>
						
						<p><b>Recommendation:</b>
						<br>I probably wouldn't recommend this for CVGC because it has a lot of small parts and can take up a lot of space.  It has a little more strategy
						than I would recommend for a quick, fun game, and it can get confusing if people don't give 100% of their focus to what is going on.  Also, there is some 
						(easy) math involved when adding up the scores and ain't nobody got time for that with all the craziness of CVGC going on around them.</p>
						
						<p><b><font size="3">Last Night on Earth: The Zombie Game</font></b></p>
						
						<p><img src="posts/2015/LastNightOnEarth.jpg" height="300" width="300"/></p>

						</p>
						
						<p>Chris was generous enough to bring along his copy of Last Night on Earth for us to try out.  I will tell you right now that I wasn't there for the initial 
						set-up and maybe the first few turns so I wasn't really sure what we were doing, I just went along with whatever I was told to do.  I am pretty sure our trial 
						run went a lot smoother and faster than intended but the heroes had some lucky draws so we won pretty quickly.</p>
						
						<p><b>About the Game:</b>
						<br>Last Night on Earth puts a team of brain eating zombies against a group of small-town heroes who must survive the night by working together and either 
						stopping the zombie horde or escaping alive.  Two to six people can play with one set controlling four heroes and one or two players controlling the zombies.  
						Each hero has their own special abilities to use while fighting for their life in several different scenarios which include survival, rescue, or escape.  
						The game is kept interesting through different character, scenario, and board combinations to offer a lot of replayability.</p>
						
						<p><b>Gameplay:</b>
						<br>I guess this can be described as a competitive cooperative game?  Is that a thing?  It is competitive because of the zombies trying to eat the brains of all 
						the living characters but it is cooperative due to the fact that the people playing as the heroes must work together to defeat the zombies.  I guess the zombie 
						players would also be considered a cooperative team but how do zombies communicate to come up with a plan?  I think it would be much more realistic if the 
						zombies just did their own thing... but that's my opinion.  Anyway, each team has a deck of cards which contains events and the heroes also have cards with 
						items.  During each round, the heroes have a turn and then the zombies take their turn.  Players and zombies move around the board and fight each other depending on 
						the objective of the scenario.  I know that doesn't tell you much, but right now I am going for a general, broad overview.  A very general, broad overview.  The 
						heroes are victorious if they are able to complete the scenario and the the zombies are the winners if they complete their scenario objective, if they kill the four 
						hero players, or if they cause the last card of the hero deck to be discarded.</p>
						
						<p>
							<b>Number of Players:</b> 2-6<br>
							<b>Play Time:</b> 60-90 minutes<br>
						</p>
						
						<p><b>Difficulty:</b>
						<br>This game was fairly easy to pick up for a first run through.  It didn't make a difference that I literally sat down and joined the fun after it had already 
						started.  I had no problem jumping in and helping the heroes demolish the zombies.  It may have taken my first turn to understand what was going on, but after that 
						I had no problem.  It probably helped that the game was cooperative because I am pretty sure that having other people on my team that knew what was going on is most 
						likely what saved me.  That being said, I think the heroes got incredibly lucky on the draws and got everything we needed in the first few turns, so the zombies 
						didn't really have much of a fair chance.</p>
						
						<p><b>Recommendation:</b>
						I can't really recommend this to play at CVGC since we don't own it, but I would probably recommend it to buy.  The modular board, multiple scenarios, and different 
						playable characters allow for a high level of replayability which would be good investment if you plan on buying it.  If somebody wants to try it out during the CVGC 
						weekend, we are going to have to nicely ask Chris if he will be willing to bring his copy along.  Otherwise, you are SOL.</p>

						<p>David bought a bunch of tabletop games off of Amazon this holiday season during a huge sale and this was one of the ones he picked up.  We have played it several 
						times because it has minimal set up, there are very few cards and pieces involved, it's easy to learn, and it does go pretty fast.  I am pretty sure we used this as a 
						break between some of the other more difficult games so that we could have a little breather and play something easy.</p>
						
						<p><b>About the Game:</b>
						<br>Love Letter is a game where you are an eligible young man who is attempting to win the affection of the Princess of Tempest.  Unfortunately, she has locked herself 
						away in her palace and you must now rely on others to get your letter of affection to the princess.  Two to four people play against each other to fight for Princess 
						Annette's affection.</p>
						
						<p><b>Gameplay:</b>
						<br>Basically, you go around the table trying to eliminate other players using the cards in your hand.  What card you play dictates what your next action will be.  You 
						go around taking turns until only one person is left or you run out of cards.  The last person remaining or the one with the highest score at the end of the round 
						receives an object of the Princess's affection, and the player who reaches the predetermined amount of objects of affection first wins.  Pretty simple.</p>
						
						<p>
							<b>Number of Players:</b> 2-4<br>
							<b>Play Time:</b> 20 minutes<br>
						</p>
						
						<p><b>Difficulty:</b>
						<br>This game is not difficult at all.  Each round should only take a few minutes and it is easy enough to pick up in one round.  Even somebody who doesn't normally
						play tabletop games should have no problem learning this one.</p>
						
						<p><b>Recommendation:</b>
						<br> I would definitely recommend this as one to play during CVGC.  Because playing this is so simple and it plays really quickly, it would be fun to do for a few 
						minutes while you are waiting for your turn in the tournament or if you just want something easy and fun.</p>
						
						<p><b><font size="3">Takenoko</font></b></p>

						<p><b>About the Game:</b>
						<br>Play as a trusted member of the Japanese Emperor's court who is given the difficult task of tending to his bamboo garden.  Players must cultivate land plots, 
						irrigate them, and grow one of the three species of bamboo, with the assistance of the Imperial Gardener, to maintain the bamboo garden.  This game supports two to 
						four players who are working against each other to earn more points.</p>
						
						<p><b>Gameplay:</b>
						<br>During Takenoko, players will farm parcels of land, irrigate them, and grow the different species of bamboo.  Each player starts with some objective cards.  Based 
						on the objectives you receive, you place the tiles, irrigate, and grow bamboo to help you complete as many objectives as possible.  A winner is declared when one 
						player completes 7-9 objectives, depending on the number of players.  After a player has reached the correct number of completed objectives, all the players add up 
						the points on their completed objective cards and the person with the most points wins the game.</p>
						
						<p>
							<b>Number of Players:</b> 2-4 (best with 3)<br>
							<b>Play Time:</b> 45 minutes<br>
						</p>
						
						<p><b>Difficulty:</b>
						<br>I thought this was fairly easy to learn.  We only played through once and I had picked up the main idea within the first move or two.</p>
						
						<p><b>Recommendation:</b>
						<br>I think that I would recommend this for play at CVGC.  Not because it involves an adorable, cute panda that can eat pink, green, and yellow bamboo, but because I 
						think it was my favorite one we played the whole weekend.  Though that may be because I had played some of the other games previously, so those weren't as exciting to 
						me.  I would recommend buying it as well, especially if you want an easy, not very confusing tabletop game.</p>
						
						<p><b><font size="3">Splendor</font></b></p>
						
						<p><img src="posts/2015/Splendor.jpg" height ="300" width="300"/></p>
						
						<p><a href="http://amzn.com/B00IZEUFIA">Amazon Link</a><br></p>
						
						<p><b>About the Game:</b>
						<br>Play as a merchant of the Renaissance trying to buy gem mines, means of transportation, and shops in an attempt to acquire the most prestige points.  If you 
						collect enough wealth, you may even receive a visit from a noble, further increasing your prestige.  This game supports two to four players, but is best experienced 
						when played with three people.</p>
						
						<p><b>Gameplay:</b>
						<br>Each person uses cards and gem chips to try and get to 15 prestige points before their fellow players.  There are three different levels of cards that can be 
						bought, each level being more difficult to acquire than the previous.  Players can pick up gems or cards on their turn so that they can purchase cards with prestige 
						points and gems on them.  Buy enough gems and you can lure nobles, which also give prestige points. </p>
						
						<p>
							<b>Number of Players:</b> 2-4 (best with 3)<br>
							<b>Play Time:</b> 30 minutes<br>
						</p>
						
						<p><b>Difficulty:</b>
						<br>I thought it was fairly easy to pick up but took a little longer to figure out the strategy.  Well, at least for me.  David always gives me a hard time about 
						taking a long time on my turn, but I am always trying to plan the next few moves, so I know what I need to do to get to where I want to be at the end.  I found 
						that it requires a lot more planning and strategy when playing with three players, rather than two, so that made it a bit more interesting and more difficult.</p>
						
						<p><b>Recommendation:</b>
						<br>I am kind of on the fence about recommending this for CVGC.  While I do enjoy a good round of Splendor as much as the next person, it may be a bit too involved.  
						Well, at least for me it would be.</p>
						
						<p><b><font size="3">Final Thoughts:</font></b>
						<br>There will be no shortage of games to play this year at CVGC.  Whether you choose to participate in the tournament or you just come to hang out, have a good 
						time, and support a good cause, there will be something fun for everybody.  Tabletop games can be a lot of fun and are a great alternative to the video games that
						I am sure you will be getting plenty of the rest of the night.</p>
						
						<p><b><font size="3">Other Game Recommendations:</font></b>
						<br> Since we have an extensive and rapidly growing tabletop selection, there is no possible way for us to try out everything we own and see if it's appropriate for play
						during CVGC.  If you have a recommendation or something you would like to bring along to share, be sure to leave a comment below.  I think the games best suited for play 
						during CVGC have short and easy to understand instructions, don't include a lot of pieces/cards/parts to keep up with, allow for cooperative play or fun competition 
						(nothing too serious!), and aren't so involved that you can't try to keep up with tournament happenings and other events going on.</p>
						<p>Also, if you see a game that you still want to play, despite my recommendations, then don't be afraid to ask for help.  We're all willing to do what we have to do 
						to get a new tabletop convert.</p> 
						<p>Here is a list of other games, in no particular order, which I will recommend for play during CVGC (and purchase) that we do own but didn't get a chance to play 
						during our tabletop weekend this year:</p>
						
						<p>
							<b>Cards Against Humanity</b> - If you have been to CVGC in the past, I am pretty sure we have played this.  We have a bunch of expansions, including the 10 Days 
							or Whatever of Kwanzaa.  This game is especially fun for a large group.  As the lady at staples made obvious, this game is not recommended if you are easily 
							offended.<br>
							<b>Boss Monster</b> - Fun retro-inspired dungeon building card game.<br>
							<b>The Resistance</b> - This is a fun, easy game for group to play where you try to guess the other players identities (resistance or spy).<br>
							<b>Pandemic</b> - Fun cooperative game where you try to save the world from a horrible pandemic.<br>
							<b>Pandemic The Cure</b> - Cooperative dice version of Pandemic.<br>
							<b>Forbidden Island</b> - Cooperative game where players try to discover all the treasures before the island sinks!<br>
						</p>
						
						<p>If you aren't very adventurous and still want to play a tabletop game, we do have the always popular games such as monopoly, jenga, scrabble, and others on hand 
						available to play if that is what you choose.  You won't be judged, too much...</p>

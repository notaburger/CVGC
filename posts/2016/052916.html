						<p>
							So David asked for a review of the new TMNT game. Well here's my synopsis thus far:
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>GAMEPLAY</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							I've been playing on Easy level and have tried out the different turtles. Between the 4, theyâ€™re all pretty well balanced as far as fighting and what not. Only difference seems to be their weapons. Special attacks can be assigned to any turtle and can also be upgraded. There are charms and scrolls that add attributes during gameplay, like 5% more training points on the summary screen. Tons of in-game goodies that you can easily use any time, like pizza slices, jump boost and speed boost drinks...gravity bombs...machine gun turrets.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>GRAPHICS</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							Pretty well done. Mostly cel-shaded like the Transformers game, but what you've seen in the trailer videos is pretty much what it is. Mainly shifts between sewers and cityscapes (Day and Night).
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>SOUND</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							Music is good...sort of dubstep-ish, a little metal, but definitely electronic. Good beats, good synths.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>DIFFICULTY</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							I personally feel that Platinum did a great job at making you realize how playing a harder difficulty level makes the game more rewarding. As I said, I've been playing on Easy and I feel like going through the game just to play the root story is actually resulting in my missing out on certain things. With harder difficulty level, you can equip more attribute charms for simultaneous upgrade effects and apparently there are hidden bosses! 
						</p>
						<p>
							This IS a short game with a fluid, rapid pace, so getting everything out of it is important. But then again, that brings in the replay value.
						</p>
						<p>
							That being said, I HIGHLY recommend playing through the training tutorial as many times as you need to to practice the controls. And so....
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>CONTROL</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							The controls are something to get used to. There are a lot of options in this game, you can switch between Turtles, communicate, use items, dodge, parry, use special attacks, and it all depends on which buttons you press. So it's kind of like playing an instrument...get good at knowing what does what so you can do it without thinking about it. Playing through Easy is definitely a good place to start, but you can get good during the tutorial as well.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>OVERALL</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							Pretty good game overall, just a little short...but that's nothing new if you've read other reviews. Pretty good diversity between enemy difficulty (Foot soldiers, Kraang UFOs, rock soldiers, others I haven't encountered yet). FYI - The Kraang UFOs are SUUUUUUPER frustrating, so be ready for those. The speech of the characters is well done and doesn't feel too cartoonish (pretty much fits that of the Nickelodeon cartoon).

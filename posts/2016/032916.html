						<p>
							PAX.  The final frontier.
						</p>
						<p>
							These are the voyages of the Starship Peggoneers<sup><a href="posts/2016/032916.html#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>.  Its three-day mission: to explore strange new games, to seek out new beers and dank memes; to boldly go where no man has gone before.
						</p>
						<p>
							This year started out the day before PAX.  Most of us arrived by 7 PM and ventured out to the Riverwalk for a good old fashioned pub crawl.  Well, old fashioned may be a stretch, but a pub crawl nonetheless!  This year's was a repeat of last year's &mdash; <a href="https://forums.penny-arcade.com/discussion/201086/a-shot-of-ice-fire-book-two-final-standings-are-up">A Shot of Ice and Fire: Book Two</a>.  Participants joined a house and toured 6 different bars (a total of 7), with a drink challenge emphasizing meeting someone from another house at each bar.  We joined House Baratheon and, naturally, decided that t-shirts needed to happen.  Thus, the infamous Beers with the Deers shirt was born.  We all agreed we would never use the word "deers" but its symmetry was a thing of beauty, nobody wanted there to be any doubt that the evening would entail more than one beer, and <a href="http://grammarist.com/plurals/deer-vs-deers/">it's technically an accepted plural</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							<a href="posts/2016/BeersWithTheDeers.png"><img src="posts/2016/BeersWithTheDeers.png" height="200px"></a>
						</p>
						<p>
							The name of the game is charity, with several items being sold and auctioned off throughout the night with all proceeds (I believe) going to Penny Arcade's charity, Childs Play.  We donated two shirts to the auction and I think most of us invested in the koozie and bottle opener our house was peddling.  Plus, I know I participated in the auction, walking away with a pint glass and shot glass, and I'm sure others did as well.
						</p>
						<p>
							Anyhow, without further ado, I shall now attempt to recount the various stops and drinks along the pub crawl.
						</p>
						<p>
							The first stop for the Deers was Buckhorn Saloon.  We showed up fashionably late and made quite the entrance with our matching shirts.  There were many hushed whispers about who these new challengers were, showing up in their quite stunning uniforms.  The challenge here was:
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Swear Allegiance to your House - Forge a new alliance. See someone on your team that looks like a good ally? Share a drink and toast to your impending house victory.</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							Thinking it was an easy challenge, I saddled up to the bar to wet my whistle and was blown away by the outrageous price.  I can't recall what it was, but I definitely remember sticker shock.  I steeled myself for a night of overspending, but was still unphased as I sipped my drink.  I believe Bobby and I had a vodka and Dr. Pepper at this establishment.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our second stop was Agave Bar &mdash; our first tequila bar of the night (with one more to follow &mdash; in a way, two, since we went to the next one twice).  Excited to try new exotic tequilas I reviewed the challenge.
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>The North Remembers &mdash; Each of you buy your favorite white shot or clear cocktail and get two extra glasses. Mix the two together in a blizzard of booze and each consume half. Hey, nobody said winter would be easy.</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							Great.  We're at a tequila bar on the Riverwalk and have to ruin two perfectly good drinks to satisfy the challenge instead of enjoying a lovely tequila.  Not to be deterred, I waited most of the hour trying to buy a drink with my new friend from House Stark.  Bobby ordered a couple White Russians for us which were a nice break from the anticipation of how I was going to ruin a drink.  While waiting, Northy and I decided to beat the system by asking the bartender to make something up for us that would satisfy the criteria of the challenge.  She said she didn't understand, to which we replied neither did we.  Clearly saying "she didn't understand" was a gross understatement, as she returned moments later with a giant chugger of some pink concoction.  Having flashbacks to the first bar, I started to worry about the price, but luckily this one was pretty cheap.  Doubly lucky because nobody in their right mind would pay for it.  But, while a man on a pub crawl can be described as many things, of sound mind is not one of them.  We easily finished our drinks and parted ways.
						</p>
						<p>
							Moving right along, we found ourselves at Swig Martini Bar.  Knowing that the challenges were fated to have nothing to do with the bar, I resigned myself to not having a martini while I waited in a miserable line.  Not to disappoint, this bar's challenge was:
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Garden of Bones &mdash; Buy a shot each of whiskey, vodka and tequila. Rock/Paper/Scissors to see who drinks each shot.</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							Great.  Could be worse.  I found myself drinking in the company of the Wildlings at this bar and was pleasantly surprised to find them mostly civilized.  Here, my drinking companion hailed from the land beyond the wall for real &mdash; Minnesota.  I asked him what brought him to PAX South and quickly realized that Minnesota is roughly in the middle of all three PAXs.  I also learned you can get a direct flight from the Gopher State to San Antonio.  But, that's beside the point &mdash; you, dear reader, care about the drinks.  Not wanting to show any signs of weakness, my chum and I each ordered up a shot of each.  Upon discussing with other, lesser combatants, we learned that everyone else just ordered one of each between them.  The wimps.  We played our Rock/Paper/Scissors and I came out one win more than him.  I tried to do the honorable thing and drink the last shot, but he would have none of it.  Not waiting to be outdone, and finding myself at a martini bar, I obviously ordered a martini.  I had the Hemingway: <i>Beefeater Gin, Noilly Prat Vermouth and Spanish cocktail onions.  "&hellip;As five o'clock approaches, my thoughts turn toward the elixir of quietude.  Gin stops the bell from tolling"</i>.  It was everything I'd wanted to have all night.  And wasn't any more expensive than the first bar and was a right proper drink.  Things were looking up.  Surely no challenge could be as bad as the last bar and its curious pink concoction.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our next bar was the second tequila bar of the night &mdash; The Worm.  Here, we would wage war with House Targaryen.  This bar's challenge was:
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>A Man Without Honor &mdash; Each member of the pair orders a beer or mixed drink. Engage in a game of 'I Never' until both drinks have been consumed. Save any dirt you learn about your opponent for future blackmail. Playing dirty in the game of thrones is expected.</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							Not bad.  I like beer.  Their selection left a bit to be desired, but not too bad.  I don't remember what I had &mdash; probably something like Modelo.  I was starting to feel pretty good by now.  This place was quite large and was the site of our first t-shirt auction, which fetched $15!  Quite the success, I'd say.  Anyhow, I managed to find a group of people that had been to all of the US PAXs to play never have I ever with and two of them were from Minnesota.  What are the odds I'd run into more people from Minnesota?  Anyway, I think we played a round or two before we all just went our own ways to enjoy our drinks.  I also purchased a moon pie from the enemies, promising to auction it off later in the night and raise even more money for House Baratheon.  Later, on Sunday, I found the moon pie in a jacket pocket.  Nobody wanted to buy it.  No matter how many times I said "think of the children".
						</p>
						<p>
							Moving right along to bar number five, we found ourselves at Waxy O'Connors where we faced off against the Lannisters.  Sounds like a place you can really get a proper pint at.
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Blackwater &mdash; Buy two shots of Jagermeister. You each tell your battle opponent 2 truths and 1 lie about yourself. If they guess the lie correctly, you take a shot. If they miss, they take a shot.</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							Or a couple shots of disgusting Jager.  I don't quite remember how it worked, but I do remember that I did this with a total of 4 people and only half of us manned up to do 2 shots of Jager.  It was kind of an unorganized mess, but the folks Drew and I drank with were fun.  I stumped our noble opponents here because they did not believe I was part of a stream on Twitch.  I think it ended with me promising that <a href="http://cvgc.net/">cvgc.net</a> would have a <a href="http://theclassacts.com/">link to our stream</a>, but that hasn't happened yet (oh shit, ninja'd it in!).  No doubt, they had no problem remembering that URL.  It's the tits.  Anyway, probably the highlight of this bar for me was the arrival of Jesse and Erin.  I think they called me (I was probably the only one to answer) and I could barely contain my excitement (I probably didn't).  Somehow I was able to provide them with instructions to our bar and they soon bolstered our troops!  Recharged by the arrival of fresh blood, we marched on to our next destination with renewed vigor!
						</p>
						<p>
							Which brings us back to The Worm.  The Night's Watch were our foes on this battleground and I was confident that the resupply would bring us a great victory! 
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Valar Morghulis &mdash; Drink a glass of water. Seriously. Drink it. Then, finish off the night with a drink of your choosing. All men must die, but not this night.</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							I definitely don't remember having the water.  Maybe I did.  I did have a drink of my choice, for sure.  Some beer.  Who knows.  I do know that this was the first full bar for Jesse and Erin!  I'm told that I fought valiantly at their side, seeking justice and their House Baratheon pins.  Or maybe it was their "mission accomplished" pins?  Who knows.  Anyhow, as I said, I fought very valiantly.
						</p>
						<p>
							Anyway, that brings us to the bonus bar.  The Davenport Lounge.  Here, we would find the corpses of all the foes we bested.
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>The Davenport Lounge with all crawlers.</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							Umm.  I'm sure I ordered a beer here, too.  Again, I probably should have ordered a water, but don't really remember.  I do remember feeling quite strongly that I owed the couple from Waxy O'Connors a drink here.  And I also remember running into them here.  I couldn't say whether or not I actually bought them said drink.  I'm inclined to think I didn't.
						</p>
						<p>
							You probably noticed a trend in how much more detailed I was in the beginning of this.  That's for two reasons: 1) I wrote the first 3/4s much closer to when PAX happened and 2) I was running out of room in my journalist notepad&trade;, so couldn't be as detailed as I would like.  It was definitely not because I was getting more drunk.
						</p>
						<p>
							Anyway, we grabbed an Uber home and lived to face another day.  But that's a tale for another post.

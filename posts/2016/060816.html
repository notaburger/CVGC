						<p>
							The charity we selected this year was the Sevastopol Station Relief Fund.  Weyland-Yutani Corp abandoned as many as 5,000 workers to fend for themselves on this station with the knowledge that a Xenomorph was killing them off.  The remaining workers have banded together and are showing the best of humanity in helping each other, but with limited resources and no way off there is little help for them.  The Sevastopol Station Relief Fund was founded in December 2137 with the goal of providing aid and ultimately evacuating any remaining survivors.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sadly, aliens got into the fund's server room and the fund is no longer operating.  Our thoughts and prayers go out to those left on the station.
						</p>
						<p>
							And so, it is with a heavy heart, that we have selected <a href="http://www.thebirthdaypartyproject.org/">The Birthday Party Project</a> as this year’s charity.
						</p>
						<p>
							All joking aside (seriously – play <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/214490/">Alien Isolation</a>), The Birthday Party Project is an amazing foundation here in the state of Texas bringing joy to homeless children across the country through the magic of birthdays.  I encourage you to find out more at their website, <a href="http://www.thebirthdaypartyproject.org/">http://www.thebirthdaypartyproject.org/</a> - I’m sure that if you visit you’ll soon forget the plight of our hopeless friends on Sevastopol Station.
						</p>
						<p>
							Anyway, in case you miss it when you check out their site, here are a few stats I found staggering:
						</p>
						<ul style="margin: 0 0 0 3.5em; padding: 0 0 1em 2.2em; border-left: 1px solid #CCCCCC;">
							<li>They will host over 370 parties this year.  For the math challenged, that’s more than 1 party/day!</li>
							<li>They’ve celebrated over 2,000 birthdays, brining joy to 17,500 kids (complete with 17,500 cupcakes!)</li>
							<li>They’ve sang Happy Birthday over 900 times (don’t worry – we’ll probably only sing it once for CVGCers with June birthdays)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Our goal this year is $1250 - enough to buy a bounce house and blower!  Or enough to host 7 birthday parties!
						</p>
						<p>
							Can't make it to CVGC but still want to make a donation?  Never fear - you can reach out to <a href="./contact.html">Big D</a> himself or <a href="https://tbpp.ejoinme.org/donate">donate here!</a>
						</p>
						<p>
							As with previous years, there will be lots of goodies auctioned off for the charity.  This year will feature some coffee mugs by Aboth and flasks and shot glasses by Saint.  It will also offer some  artwork from notgoodatgames and Doc Brown.  And some next level jerky made by Aboth and notgoodatgames will be available for donation.  Oh, and Woot has lost his mind and is cosplaying and posing for photos for donations.  Or charging a donation to not pose for photos with you.  TBD.

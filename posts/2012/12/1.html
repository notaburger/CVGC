						Hey everyone, I bet you thought you'd never hear from me and this site again! <br> First, as Ricky would say, I've got some "splainin" to do.  I'm sorry for ignoring everyone and neglecting this site for so long.  My excuses are as follows: <br><br>

						<ul>
							<li>Pregnant Wife</li>
							<li>Baby</li>
							<li>Laziness</li>
						</ul>
						<br><br>
						
						Alright, I agree that those reasons may sound like scapegoats, but I don't care and, quite honestly, neither do you.<br>

						Now that that's out of the way, let's get down to business.<br><br>

						<h2>CVGC 2012</h2>
						I hope everyone had a wonderful time (I know that Erica and I did).  Here's the short version of what went well and what didn't go so well.<br><br>

						<blockquote>
							<h3>The good</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>We raised $XXX to help people pay for cancer treatment!  This may not sound like a lot (each round of chemo can run in the hundreds of thousands of dollars) but it'll certainly help someone out there that makes too much to qualify for governmental assistance but not enough to be able to afford it.</li>
								<li>I know a few people bought games for Child's Play Charity in ADDITION to giving money to the kitty at the event.  I can't explain how awesome that is. Games are a great way for kids to learn hand/eye coordination skills, challenge their brains, and, yes, even escape for a few minutes from stress.  Since the kids can't say it to you, I will...THANK YOU!</li>
								<li>Lots of people showed up and chipped in.  In no particular order we had a team of guys help with the trophies (special recognition for Jesse here), Woot brewed some beer, Erin made some kickass shirts, and Charles organized food and assisted w/ creating the leader boards.  If I'm forgetting someone, please point out my ignorance in the comments.</li>
								<li>Drinks.  I think keeping the liquor out of reach was a good call Charles.  It was all still there, but nothing got out of hand.</li>
								<li>Gifts.  It seems like most people liked their koozies, so I'm going to ramp it up a bit for next year.  Don't hold me to this, but expect something a little more substantial next year.</li>
								<li>The night before was a lot of fun too.  Board/Card games will probably see more of a jump next year.</li>
							</ul>
						</blockquote>
						<br><br>
	
						<blockquote>
							<h3>The meh</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Too many games!  We had to cut some great ones from the lineup, so this next year I'm going to scale the number back.  Instead of focusing ALL night on the tournament, I'm going to shift it down to a couple of hours.  That way we can spend the rest of the night in "freeplay mode" where people hop around and play whatEVER they want.  It'll be better for everyone as it's hard to keep people's focus for 6 hours of anything.  I also think it will improve the spectator aspect of the event as everyone won't have to run around and fit in games all the time.  Check out the pictures during the 2 on 2 ice hockey game.  Having 10 people cheer you on or curse your name definitely makes the games more fun.</li>
							</ul>
						</blockquote>
						<br><br>

						<h2>CVGC 2013</h2>
						
						BIG SURPRISE!  We're going to do this again next year.  I'll give you a minute to pick your jaw up off of the floor.  Go on!  I can wait.  This is just a primer and none of this is finalized yet.  I just want to get people to start thinking about the event and how they want to be involved.<br><br>


						1) Timing<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Expect it to take place in early Q2 of 2013.  I'm thinking May like it was in 2012.</li>
						</ul><br>
						
						2) Gameplan<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Smaller games list</li>
							<li>Total entries will be limited to 16.  If we get more people than that interested in being in the event, then volunteers will get chosen first.  If necessary, those that have played in previous years get the first opportunity to sign up.</li>
							<li>More emphasis will be spent on playing random games outside of the tournament.  That means if two hardcore StarCraft players want to organize a massive team battle (or tournament), they will be able to....speaking of which, maybe Thibault should just plan on setting this up.</li>
							<li>Mohr pictures!  This year the party will be set up as a Google+ event.  So download the app for your smartphone and snap away.  As you do that it will automatically upload all pictures to the event page on Google+.  Pretty swanky.</li>
						</ul><br>
						
						3) Volunteers<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Same deal as last year.  I need people to step up to try and make this the best CVGC yet!</li>
							<li>We need the following:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Food organizer</li>
								<li>Beer brewer (or assistant)...we polished off 2.5 kegs of beer and 1 of root beer so I need someone to step up and help supply this time</li>
								<li>Logo designer (I think we're due for a new one this year)</li>
								<li>Game organizer (during free play time we will need people running games (video AND board), setting up tournaments, etc.)</li>
								<li>Guest posters on the site - I would like it if some of you would consider creating blog posts for the site.  It can be anything gaming related as long as it is cool or interesting.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul><br>

						4) Trophy<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Previous winners:  Make sure that you have your Rupee all polished up and ready to go to pass on to the next group of winners.  No one has been able to make theirs shine yet, so if you come up with a way to make them look nicer, please share it with me and I'll let the other winners know.</li>
						</ul><br><br>

						As stated before, I'm going to make an event page on Google+, so please provide your email address to me.  Once you're in, that's where I'll post updates from the site so that you don't have to keep an eye on this page.<br>
						
						Tons more detail will be coming in the near future.  Please leave any suggestions/comments in the comments section below!<br>

						I hope everyone likes the amount of trouble that goes into this site.  I realize that it's sort of dumb and a waste of time (as most don't read it) but I tend to enjoy it.<br>

						Alright.  So I'm a little bit late.  Better late than never?  Let's get this show on the road:<br><br>
						<h2>The Games</h2>

							<img src="posts/2014/burnout.jpg" title="Burnout 3" alt="" /><br>
							<span class="dark">
								<b>Platform:</b> Xbox<br>
								<b>Scoring:</b> Top Score, 3 Tries<br>
								<b>Details:</b> If you haven't played this before, it's pretty simple to explain.  You drive really fast, hit a ramp, and then try to take down as many other vehicles as humanly possible.  You HAVE to make sure that you pick up the multipliers if you expect to get a top score; NO QUESTION.  I know that it hasn't been stated really anywhere else, but everyone can feel free to practice the games as much as they want.  The only requirement is that they formally announce when they are going for their "real" run.<br>
								<b>Tips:</b> Did I mention?  GET THE MULTIPLIERS!</span></li><br>
							<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man_Vs.">Pac-Man Vs.</a><br>
							<img src="posts/2014/pacman.jpg" title="Pacman Vs" alt="" /><br>
							<span class="dark">
								<b>Platform:</b> Gamecube/Gameboy Advance<br>
								<b>Scoring:</b> Top Score, First Round Determines Seed<br>
								<b>Details:</b> Let's face it.  If you are here,  you have heard of Pac-Man (or Puck-Man if you're a hipster).  You have also probably heard of his independent wife, Ms. Pac-Man (hear her roar).  It's possible that you've even heard of his child that spawned a weird pinball/arcade hybrid, Baby Pac-Man.  Although I seriously doubt that more than a handful of you have ever seen or heard of this game.  It was never even really released by itself.  It was given away, packaged in as a freebie, and included on a random (albeit terrible) DS compilation.  This is the only version of Pac-Man (that I'm aware of) that puts you in control of one of the iconic ghosts, where you try to track down that smug pizza shaped protagonist.  One person randomly gets chosen to be Pac-Man, and they play the normal game on the Gameboy Advance screen.  The other three players are ghosts and get a fancy 3D view with limited sight.  The trick is that the ghosts have to work together to take down the Pac all while making sure that they're the actual one that does it.  The ghost that catches His Yellowness gets to take control of him.  This game is surely to be a crowd pleaser.<br>
								<b>Tips:</b> Practice your Pacman skills.  If you get to be the great one, don't lose control.  It's THAT simple.</span></li><br>
							<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parappa_the_rapper">PaRappa the Rapper</a><br>
							<img src="posts/2014/parappa.jpg" title="PaRappa the Rapper" alt="" /><br>
							<span class="dark">
								<b>Platform:</b> Playstation<br>
								<b>Scoring:</b> Top Score on "You Gotta Believe!" (sorry, only ONE TRY ON THIS ONE!)<br>
								<b>Details:</b> PaRappa gets a bad rap (haha).  He's probably known more for his marketability than the actual quality of his game.  This game packed together the tightest, most original visuals that the Playstation had seen along with a clever rhythm game with catchy tunes and charm to spare.  You are guaranteed to be humming these tunes throughout the weekend.<br>
								<b>Tips:</b> Practice hitting the buttons to the vocal beats.  Don't try to sync up the button presses with the scrolling marker.  Trust me on this one.  Oh yeah...and PRACTICE!  <a href="http://youtu.be/AJG3uncnJ6A?t=2m28s">YOU GOTTA BELIEVE!</a></span></li><br>
						</ol>
						That'll do for now.  I'm planning on releasing the final few games tomorrow.  Also, be sure and lock in your RSVP on the Facebook by Sunday night.  I'm going to start making the brackets Monday so I need a firm roster.<br><br>

      <h1>CVGC <span class="dark">Mission Statement</span></h1>
		   
	   <p>
		I love games.  I've been playing them religiously for over 23 years of my life.  Somewhere around 2004 I thought it would be a good idea to start buying NES cartridges from the local used video game shop in College Station, TX (FX Game Exchange).  Purchasing games quickly went from being a "once-a-year" activity to something I'd think about every day.  </br></br>
		The itch to collect had been an addiction that I had blocked out of my life ever since I gave away my entire baseball card collection for an old Game Boy back in late 90s (something I do not regret to this day).  Initially, I justified collecting games since I could play with them.  Very quickly, I started to procure games faster than I could realistically play them.  This is where the idea of the Classic Video Game Challenge was born.  This is an opportunity for these games to be enjoyed like they were meant to be.</br></br>
		So what is the CVGC?  It's an annual all weekend extravaganza devoted to the "World of Game" that culminates with a marathon gaming tournament that spans various game styles, systems, and decades.  It doesn't matter if you grew up exploring castles with Simon Belmont, breaking the speed of sound with Sonic, or even terrorizing the streets of Liberty City with a Sports Car and a Shotgun, if you like video games, the CVGC is for you.</br></br>
		The first night and following day of the weekend is a free-for-all gaming party.  Beer is consumed, video games are played, smiles are generated.</br>
		....and then, on the last evening of the CVGC, the classic video game tournament is held.</br>
		8 games</br>
		1 (very long) night</br>
		The Main Event is designed to test the player's versatility as a gamer.  There will be games that challenge the player's speed, their dexterity, their endurance, and even their ability to cooperate on a team.  The winner earns bragging rights and a kick ass trophy.  What type of trophy you ask?  A kick ass one I reiterate.</br></br>
		Sure, there are similar events held every day across the globe.  The intent of this is not to find the iron man of electronic gaming, it's a celebration of the games themselves and the time in which they came from.
